			<string>Hi there! üëãüèΩ</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>The Biofeedback Upper-Limb Device for Impairment (BUDI) is an Apple Watch &amp; iPhone application designed to help children with motor disabilities with therapy &amp; mobility.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>You are invited to participant in testing the beta version of the Biofeedback Upper-Limb Device for Impairment (BUDI).  BUDI is an Apple Watch &amp; iPhone application designed to help children with motor disabilities with therapy &amp; mobility.  You were selected as a possible participant because you (1) have a diagnosis of cerebral palsy or (2) are a healthy volunteer aged 5-60 and can provide feedback regarding the user experience for remote therapy.  BUDI creates a digital platform to facilitate remote upper limb therapy &amp; motivate you to reach a daily therapy goal.  This is particularly important for children with cerebral palsy and others with hemiparetic neurological injuries who require daily therapy to improve upper limb function.  You could think of BUDI as a daily therapy goal; perhaps your ‚Äútherapy ring‚Äù for Apple Watch. 

For simplicity, BUDI approaches a therapy goal as a combination of gross motor therapy &amp; fine motor therapy.  Gross motor therapy is measured on BUDI by starting a therapy on your Apple Watch application &amp; practicing stretching your upper extremity as you do in occupational &amp; physical therapy. Fine motor therapy is measured by completing Finger &amp; Dexterity ActiveTasks designed by Apple Health on your iPhone application. 

Accordingly, BUDI uses sensors from Apple Watch &amp; tools from open-source Apple databases like CardinalKit, ResearchKit, CareKit, &amp; HealthKit to obtain objective measures of gross motor therapy (CoreMotion &amp; Workouts) and fine motor therapy (via ActiveTasks &amp; dexterity games) to provide biofeedback on daily arm usage, ‚Äúgameify‚Äù rehabilitation, and ultimately encourage mobility to prevent adverse musculoskeletal outcomes.</string>

			<string>Data Gathering</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>BUDI will ask for 

1) your type of motor impairment,

2) your motion data, and

3) your Apple Health Data.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>BUDI will first ask you questions about you questions about your physical condition. This will help the BUDI team better understand how the digital platform affects various motor deficits seen in cerebral palsy and neuromuscular disorders.

Next, BUDI will ask to access your Motion Hardware Data. This will allow the BUDI team to build interactive, real-time therapeutic environments and detect therapeutic movements in your therapy sessions. BUDI will also ask to access your Apple Health Data in order to store your therapy sessions and document your trends over time you and your healthcare providers.</string>

			<string>Privacy &amp; Data Use</string>
			<key>Summary</key>
			<string>Only the BUDI Team and those who you authorize will be able to access your data. BUDI will use your motion &amp; health data to help design the best digital solution for pediatric rehabilitation therapy.</string>
			<key>Content</key>
			<string>The data collected in the BUDI Apple Watch &amp; iPhone applications may be used only by the BUDI team and parties authorized to see data stored in the Apple Health App for the purposes of understanding the potential benefits of a remote therapy iOS/watchOS platform and improving the user interface/user experience. Your identity and/or your personal health information will not be disclosed except as authorized by you or as required by law. However, there is always some risk that even de-identified information might be re-identified. Patient information may be provided to Federal and other regulatory agencies as required.</string>
